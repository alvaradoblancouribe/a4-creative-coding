## Public Schools, Fire Departments, Police Stations, and Hospitals in Boston

https://a4-alvaradoblancouribe.glitch.me/

this application displays the public schools, hospitals, police stations, and fire departments in Boston. Hover over the locations to learn more about each location. In addition, a color themed animation is attached in the botton right. The map was created with d3.js and the animation was created with three.js 

The main challenge was that the idea that i had for this application changed a lot. Therefore, I completed multiple tutorials and debugged a lot to get to this point - even though it might look somewhat incomplete. No additional instructions are needed.
